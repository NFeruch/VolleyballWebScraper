# WebScraping_VolleyballClubs

This is web scraping project that was done for a client on Upwork - the project posting can be found here https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~015ddd538746ecf0d8/

### Objective:
* Visit the [USA Volleyball Clubs Directory](http://www.usavolleyballclubs.com/volleyballclubdirectory.asp) and scrape all the information pertaining to each club

### Caveats:
  1) Some clubs had extra information that was accessed by clicking on the club link, which meant scraping 2 pages for 1 club
